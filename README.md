# Coup-React

WIP Demo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPe_mdcDcUk

Based on the popular board game Coup! https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131357/coup

Play with your friends! One player hosts the game and sends the room code to the rest of the players. Once everybody's in, the host can start the game.

To play the game, players take turns taking actions based on what cards they are dealt at the beginning of the game. Bluffing is allowed and encouraged! Be the last one standing to win the game!

This project is WIP and not all features are fully implemented.
